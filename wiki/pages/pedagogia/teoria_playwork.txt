### Play types

There are many differing ways of identifying types of play. Until you have stopped and considered this, it may seem like utter nonsense. “Play is play!” Not so.
Think about this. A fixed playspace in a park will offer one type of play, the sort that uses big body movement. It offers swings or climbing frames or slides.
But if I asked you how you played as a child, I think that you would remember many things that were not like this. You may remember playing with grandma’s perfume bottles—the touch and smell and beauty of the objects. You may have put on shows, dressed up, or pretended to have weddings. You may have played hide and seek and perhaps played with fire or water or mud or sand.

In the U.K. Bob Hughes has rooted through all the literature he could find and has identified through research and observation of children 16 different play types. These are what we use in the U.K. to inform our practice.

Perhaps the most intriguing of these is what he terms “recapitulative play.” This is based on the knowledge that the human brain is born incompletely formed in terms of size and complexity. (It has to be, for logistical, birth-related reasons.) So the brain grows very quickly in the first ten or so years of life. The fine points of its architecture change. It develops more filing cabinets and the capacity to fill those filing cabinets with stuff, and creates a complex network of connections between the cabinets. The theory goes like this—children learn through their early playing the skills that are responsive to the environment and vital to the survival of the species. This has happened throughout the development of humankind. We learn to make shelters and run and hide and climb and dam streams and irrigate fields and absorb the individual customs and identities of our tribe, child care practices, communication, relationships, and much more through the practice of play.

Bob Hughes has gathered information about all the types of play in what he calls a “taxonomy of play.” It is a useful diagnostic tool for playworkers. They use it to check the availability of equipment and materials of a play setting along with the opportunities that it provides for diverse forms of play.
An excellent example of this comes from observations on a play site where the staff noticed that there was no obvious invitation to children to experience the dramatic play types. They built a stage out of tables and made a Heath Robinson23 curtain and before this work was done the children had started to put on “Little Orphan Annie.” This dramatic play continued long after the impromptu production was ended, with dressing up and performance and domestic dramas being acted out all over the site. It was as if a deep thirst had been quenched and the children now felt liberated to indulge in these types of playing. Some three years on, these same children spoke excitedly about this memory

Here are Hughes’s 16 play types with some illustrative examples:

* Symbolic play—when a stick becomes a horse
* Rough and tumble play—play fighting
* Socio-dramatic play—social drama
* Social play—playing with rules and societal structures
* Creative play—construction and creation
* Communications play—e.g., words, jokes, acting, body and sign languages, facial expressions
* Dramatic play—performing or playing with situations that are not personal or domestic, e.g., playing “Harry Potter” or doing a “Harry Potter play”
* Deep play—risky experiences that confront fear
* Exploratory play—manipulating, experimenting
* Fantasy play—rearranges the world in the child’s fantastical way
* Imaginative play—pretending
* Locomotor play—chase, swinging, climbing, playing with the movements of your body
* Mastery play—lighting fires, digging holes, games of elemental control
* Object play—playing with objects and exploring their uses and potential
* Recapitulative play—carrying forward the evolutionary deeds of becoming a human being, e.g., dressing up with paints and masks, damming streams, growing food
* Role play—exploring other ways of being, pretending to drive a bus or be a policeman or use a telephone

### Playwork Principles

This is a curiously vital and useful piece of work. The history of the
Playwork Principles is available through Play Wales (see www.playwales. org.uk).
The playwork sector was invited to respond to a document produced by Bob Hughes, Gordon Sturrock and Mick Conway.27

The responses were collated and condensed by a scrutiny group that amalgamated them into the Playwork Principles. The process was honest and scrupulous. I know; I was a member of that group. Although the process was coordinated by Play Wales, the principles are embraced by the playwork profession throughout the four nations of the U.K.
They describe, clearly and succinctly, the ethos of our craft. They are a delight to work with and will probably be very useful for some time.

Here they are: 

1. All children and young people need to play. The impulse to play is innate. Play is a biological, psychological, and social necessity, and is fundamental to the healthy development and well being of individuals and communities. 

2. Play is a process that is freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated. That is, children and young people determine and control the content and intent of their play by following their own instincts, ideas, and interests, in their own way, for their own reasons. 

3. The prime focus and essence of playwork is to support and facilitate the play process and this should inform the development of play policy, strategy, training, and education. 

4. For playworkers, the play process takes precedence and playworkers act as advocates for play when engaging with adult-led agendas. 

5. The role of the playworker is to support all children and young people in the creation of a space in which they can play. 

6. The playworker’s response to children and young people playing is based on a sound up-to-date knowledge of the play process, and reflective practice. 

7. Playworkers recognize their own impact on the playspace and also the impact of children and young people’s play on the playworker. 

8. Playworkers choose an intervention style that enables children and young people to extend their play. All playworker intervention must balance risk with the developmental benefit and well being of children.

### Adulteration

One of the most basic underpinnings of the craft of the playworker is to understand that the play of children within the boundaries of a play setting must remain unadulterated by external agendas. This means that playworkers do not try to educate, train, tame, or therapeutically treat children in their time and space for play.
They do not coach sports or teach art, drama, or dance, or even circus skills. They do not do “activities.”

A good playworker will have resources as readily available as a first aid kit so that if and when children come and ask for face painting or a deck of cards these materials or their approximations can be furnished to them. What a playworker does not do is schedule events and say, “This afternoon we will be face painting and playing canasta. Then you will do 30 minutes of ‘keep-fit’ and then have a healthy snack.”
This contaminates the play frame and corrupts the freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated playing that children must experience.

### Cloak of invisibility 

This item is another essential ingredient in the tool kit of the playworker. (See Adulteration.) Go back to your most vivid childhood memories of play. Chances are you were playing outside with no adults present. Part of the oxymoronic nature of playwork is that we need to be present and not present at the same time. For those of you with a cloak of invisibility this is easy. For the rest of us, we have to learn skilful modes of intervention that allow us to support the play process without adulterating it with our own agendas.

As part of our reflective practice we have to be ever aware that not only do our presence and our reactions have a direct impact on the children, but the playing of the children has a direct impact upon us. (See Playwork Principles.) The cloak of invisibility also protects us from transference/projection, which is described below. The very awareness of transference mitigates its effects in our practice. With a cloak of invisibility, playwork is easy. Without it, we have to find ways to manage, and this means knowing the theories of play and best practices of supporting play and then applying these theories and practices.

One day in London’s Mile End Park I watched as Joe, a playworker, worked with a group of children at the Festival of Earth. He set up the clay and water table with a perimeter wall of clay and then idly played with it himself, seeming to explore not only its potential but to validate the messiness of it. Then the children came, and he seemed to disappear. This happened time and time again. A child would be stuck, perhaps needing something like a small world toy. Rather than have the child surface from her immersion in the play, Joe would become briefly visible, the item or support that was needed would quietly appear near enough for the child to discover it for herself, and then Joe would fade away again. Yet he never left the space that the children were in.

I watched him doing this and still could not work out quite how he managed to be so effective and so invisible at the same time.


### Trivialization of play

This is a state of mind that perceives and positions play as trivial fripperies that are permissible for a few years in early childhood at a time when children (generally considered to be adults in training) can waste time with idle inane fun. It becomes infantilized. It is a brightly colored phenomenon, primary colors usually, though bubble gum pink is allowed. It is not thought to have any considerable substance and certainly does not fulfill any function—other than creating Kodak moments of fun. Balloons, bouncy castles, zoomorphic face painting, and jolly dungareed party entertainers are obligatory.

This perception of play has nothing to do with the processes of playing that allow the internal world of the child to come out and discover how to experience and assimilate the external world. It does not entertain the thought that the need for play stretches over many thousands of years and is in the business of giving voice to the richest emotional pallet. Instead, it is a world filled with the equivalent of the springy chickens one finds on playgrounds.

### Commodification of play

We spend a fortune on toys for children, on experiences and entertainments.
Big business has targeted childhood as a captive market. Sell parents the concept that an idyllic childhood can be bought and sit back and count the zeros. Childhood is spent with screens and plastic geegaws. Birthday parties cost a bomb. Days out are bought times.

Because of this materialistic approach to play and childhood, many children have gotten the message that valid experiences are bought experiences, a financial deal. If we take them to the beach, sit back, and let them play for as long as they like, they don’t necessarily know what to do. Because there is no price attached to the experience, it does not feel valid to them. Have you had your play validated today?

If we focus on the validation of play through intelligent observation and reflection we can create a different currency. Let’s go back to the cardboard box as a loose part, a simple, open-ended play material that can be used in dozens of ways. This is a truly marvellous play opportunity.

I visited a family in San Francisco. They had recently discovered that their very small children did not need to join clubs and after-school activities or watch videos to have a rich and fulfilled childhood. I went into the house and the eldest child called out for permission to get the boxes from the den to make a building. He and his little sister built and imagined and negotiated while they explored my playfulness as a safe stranger in their home, under the aegis of their mother, and showed me illustrations from their books of the animals that they were being in their games.

Their mom had spoken about the peer pressure she felt to send her children to art-soccer-drama-gym classes. These were very young children who had narrowly escaped being sorted by age into adult-organized activities. And here they were, playing richly together, developing physical, emotional, linguistic, and social skills and so much more than they would have had the chance to do if they had been ferried around from class to class as part of a purchased childhood. Gordon
Sturrock12 mischievously suggests a “penny on the pound” tax on all childhood marketing and products, the revenue to be turned over to the play sector.

We need to validate playing in a real and personal and local way, not sit back and allow the process of childhood to be stolen from our children. Childhood should not be for sale.
