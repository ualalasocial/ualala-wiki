### 1. What Playworkers Do

>People always want to begin by defining play, but playworker and play theorist Gordon Sturrock says, “Trying to define play is like trying to define love. You can’t do it. It’s too big for that.”

Las personas siempre quieren comenzar por definir qué es el juego, pero el facilitador y teórico de juego Gordon Sturrck dice que "intentar definir el juego es como tratar de definir el amor. Es demasiado grande para eso."

> Instead, playworkers and theorists describe play this way:

En cambio, los facilitadores y teóricos describen el juego de la siguiente manera:

> Play is a set of behaviors that are freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated.

El juego es una serie de actos que se eligen de forma libre, se dirigen personalmente y son motivados intrínsecamente.

> You probably just read that and didn’t really take it in. Go back and read the sentence again and think about what it means and what this playing might look and feel like.

Probalemente no lo hayas comprendido bien. Vuelve atrás y lee nuevamente esa oración y piensa qué significa y como se verá y sentirá esa forma de juego.

> Play is a process, not a product. We have to learn to trust to the innate wisdom of children and allow them to get on with it. Sturrock also says that play is both doing and becoming. It is in the moment and should be valued as such.

Jugar es un proceso, no un producto. Tenemos que aprender a confiar en la sabiduría innata de los niñxs y permitirles que sigan adelante con ella. Sturrock dice también que jugar es hacer y llegar a ser. Es en el momento y debería valorado como tal.

> Arthur Battram4 says that it is through play that we become human. Play informs our adult worlds. Not that we are thinking of this when we play as children, of course. As adults, however, we should be aware that real playing is almost the most important thing that our children can do.


> It is worth noting that children all over the world, when allowed to play freely, develop very similar play patterns. It is through this playing that children integrate their internal and external worlds, according to Winnicott (see below). A diverse group of children sharing time and space will play together. It would seem that play is, universally, a primary language of children.


#### Children need to play

Children are people between birth and the late teens.
The older ones are sometimes called youth or young people. They all need to play, although the playing they do changes as they grow. Especially when they are young, children need to play for many reasons. They need to be in control of the content and intent of their play, as the Playwork Principles in the U.K. say. If they are given time and space to do this, then they will experience a broad range of play types. This has a positive impact upon their full development, including neural development.
Human infants are born with a brain that is not fully developed.

The architecture of the human brain changes rapidly in the first few years of life. Animal researchers have shown that the brain grows largest in proportion to the body in animals that play the most. It is easy to imagine that similar growth happens in human beings. But it is also easy to imagine what happens to children who do not have this experience in their lives. The study of children who suffer from play deprivation is just beginning.

#### The first adventure playgrounds

In 1946 a quirk of fate led Lady Allen of Hurtwood5 to visit a junk playground in Copenhagen-Emdrup, designed by the architect C. Th. Sorensen in 1943. He was commissioned by the authorities to create a place for children to play in response to increased levels of child delinquency during the German occupation. So Sorensen went back to look at other playgrounds that he had designed. He found them empty. Where were the children? They were playing in the wreckage of bombed-out buildings. So this is what he created: A place with materials that children could manipulate, where they could spend hours rooting around unnoticed and lost in their own worlds.

Lady Allen said of her visit to this playground, “I was completely swept off my feet by my first visit to the Emdrup playground. In a flash of understanding I realized that I was looking at something quite new and full of possibilities.”6 She brought the concept back to London and gave it the name “adventure playground.”

At that time London children had little space to play except for bomb sites left after the Second World War. Here they spent their time building, making fires, digging for treasure from the dead homes, and generally scrubbing around on their own. Lady Allen had had a very playful rural childhood. She thought that her own experiences had been ideal and recognized in the sites she created with local communities a “compensatory environment.” By this she meant they were the nearest thing to her rural childhood that could be created for urban children.

Think of an adventure playground as an urban countryside, where children can experience all sorts of play that they might have only with great difficulty in the city. Its adult designers should examine the environment around it and compensate for the deficits. If children have no access to trees, then work with them to build something they can climb. (When asked what the big structures were for on his adventure playground, Bob Hughes7 said, “They are for trees.”)

An adventure playground should be in a constant process of change, directed, informed, and executed by the children and their playing and supported by the playworkers. It is a space that allows for all the different types of play to be discovered by children. It is a place of psychological safety and calculated risk.

It may be helpful to think of an adventure playground as a Gesamtkunstwerk, or “total artwork,” a space and time where all one’s senses are engaged.

#### From warden to playworker

The first bomb-site adventure playgrounds were staffed by “wardens.”
These persons kept the keys for the tool sheds, which held the building materials and bits and pieces that the children needed for their playing.

This role rapidly developed. As the wardens watched the children they realized something of the wonder that is play. One of the first adventure playground wardens, Pat Turner, wrote a book about his time at Lollard playground that he called Something Extraordinary.

The wardens became advocates for children’s play. They gathered materials and local support and facilitated the play processes of the children. As wardens exchanged information, they realized that they were all seeing similar things. They became “play leaders” and then “playworkers,” because they understood that they must not be leading the play of children—rather, they should be working with the play.

Playworkers like Bob Hughes and many others began to research and write about playwork. This was new. All previous work on play had had a different purpose, such as education or therapy, which framed the theory and writings. To write about play itself was a challenge and demanded a whole new way of thinking. Working with play became a respected profession. Today, playworkers frequently work with regional and national play associations and help develop play policies. They are well trained and can earn vocational certificates or diplomas in playwork at the bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral level.

The term playwork is deliberately oxymoronic. It is a craft filled with paradoxes. The playworkers are aware that in an ideal world they should not need to exist. They manage the spaces for children’s play, but this work needs to be as invisible and unobtrusive to children as possible.

The ideal playworker leaves the children free to play for themselves but intervenes in carefully measured ways to support the play process. She is aware of her own playfulness, but does not impose it upon the children. She must necessarily be devoted to the playing of the children, but shun the popular role of Pied Piper. Play is the children’s business.

### 2. Play types

There are many differing ways of identifying types of play. Until you have stopped and considered this, it may seem like utter nonsense. “Play is play!” Not so.
Think about this. A fixed playspace in a park will offer one type of play, the sort that uses big body movement. It offers swings or climbing frames or slides.
But if I asked you how you played as a child, I think that you would remember many things that were not like this. You may remember playing with grandma’s perfume bottles—the touch and smell and beauty of the objects. You may have put on shows, dressed up, or pretended to have weddings. You may have played hide and seek and perhaps played with fire or water or mud or sand.

In the U.K. Bob Hughes has rooted through all the literature he could find and has identified through research and observation of children 16 different play types. These are what we use in the U.K. to inform our practice.

Perhaps the most intriguing of these is what he terms “recapitulative play.” This is based on the knowledge that the human brain is born incompletely formed in terms of size and complexity. (It has to be, for logistical, birth-related reasons.) So the brain grows very quickly in the first ten or so years of life. The fine points of its architecture change. It develops more filing cabinets and the capacity to fill those filing cabinets with stuff, and creates a complex network of connections between the cabinets. The theory goes like this—children learn through their early playing the skills that are responsive to the environment and vital to the survival of the species. This has happened throughout the development of humankind. We learn to make shelters and run and hide and climb and dam streams and irrigate fields and absorb the individual customs and identities of our tribe, child care practices, communication, relationships, and much more through the practice of play.

Bob Hughes has gathered information about all the types of play in what he calls a “taxonomy of play.” It is a useful diagnostic tool for playworkers. They use it to check the availability of equipment and materials of a play setting along with the opportunities that it provides for diverse forms of play.
An excellent example of this comes from observations on a play site where the staff noticed that there was no obvious invitation to children to experience the dramatic play types. They built a stage out of tables and made a Heath Robinson23 curtain and before this work was done the children had started to put on “Little Orphan Annie.” This dramatic play continued long after the impromptu production was ended, with dressing up and performance and domestic dramas being acted out all over the site. It was as if a deep thirst had been quenched and the children now felt liberated to indulge in these types of playing. Some three years on, these same children spoke excitedly about this memory

Here are Hughes’s 16 play types with some illustrative examples:

* Symbolic play—when a stick becomes a horse
* Rough and tumble play—play fighting
* Socio-dramatic play—social drama
* Social play—playing with rules and societal structures
* Creative play—construction and creation
* Communications play—e.g., words, jokes, acting, body and sign languages, facial expressions
* Dramatic play—performing or playing with situations that are not personal or domestic, e.g., playing “Harry Potter” or doing a “Harry Potter play”
* Deep play—risky experiences that confront fear
* Exploratory play—manipulating, experimenting
* Fantasy play—rearranges the world in the child’s fantastical way
* Imaginative play—pretending
* Locomotor play—chase, swinging, climbing, playing with the movements of your body
* Mastery play—lighting fires, digging holes, games of elemental control
* Object play—playing with objects and exploring their uses and potential
* Recapitulative play—carrying forward the evolutionary deeds of becoming a human being, e.g., dressing up with paints and masks, damming streams, growing food
* Role play—exploring other ways of being, pretending to drive a bus or be a policeman or use a telephone

### 3. Playwork Principles

This is a curiously vital and useful piece of work. The history of the
Playwork Principles is available through Play Wales (see www.playwales. org.uk).
The playwork sector was invited to respond to a document produced by Bob Hughes, Gordon Sturrock and Mick Conway.27

The responses were collated and condensed by a scrutiny group that amalgamated them into the Playwork Principles. The process was honest and scrupulous. I know; I was a member of that group. Although the process was coordinated by Play Wales, the principles are embraced by the playwork profession throughout the four nations of the U.K.
They describe, clearly and succinctly, the ethos of our craft. They are a delight to work with and will probably be very useful for some time.

Here they are:

1. All children and young people need to play. The impulse to play is innate. Play is a biological, psychological, and social necessity, and is fundamental to the healthy development and well being of individuals and communities.

2. Play is a process that is freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated. That is, children and young people determine and control the content and intent of their play by following their own instincts, ideas, and interests, in their own way, for their own reasons.

3. The prime focus and essence of playwork is to support and facilitate the play process and this should inform the development of play policy, strategy, training, and education.

4. For playworkers, the play process takes precedence and playworkers act as advocates for play when engaging with adult-led agendas.

5. The role of the playworker is to support all children and young people in the creation of a space in which they can play.

6. The playworker’s response to children and young people playing is based on a sound up-to-date knowledge of the play process, and reflective practice.

7. Playworkers recognize their own impact on the playspace and also the impact of children and young people’s play on the playworker.

8. Playworkers choose an intervention style that enables children and young people to extend their play. All playworker intervention must balance risk with the developmental benefit and well being of children.

### 4. Adulteration

One of the most basic underpinnings of the craft of the playworker is to understand that the play of children within the boundaries of a play setting must remain unadulterated by external agendas. This means that playworkers do not try to educate, train, tame, or therapeutically treat children in their time and space for play.
They do not coach sports or teach art, drama, or dance, or even circus skills. They do not do “activities.”

A good playworker will have resources as readily available as a first aid kit so that if and when children come and ask for face painting or a deck of cards these materials or their approximations can be furnished to them. What a playworker does not do is schedule events and say, “This afternoon we will be face painting and playing canasta. Then you will do 30 minutes of ‘keep-fit’ and then have a healthy snack.”
This contaminates the play frame and corrupts the freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated playing that children must experience.

### 5. Cloak of invisibility

This item is another essential ingredient in the tool kit of the playworker. (See Adulteration.) Go back to your most vivid childhood memories of play. Chances are you were playing outside with no adults present. Part of the oxymoronic nature of playwork is that we need to be present and not present at the same time. For those of you with a cloak of invisibility this is easy. For the rest of us, we have to learn skilful modes of intervention that allow us to support the play process without adulterating it with our own agendas.

As part of our reflective practice we have to be ever aware that not only do our presence and our reactions have a direct impact on the children, but the playing of the children has a direct impact upon us. (See Playwork Principles.) The cloak of invisibility also protects us from transference/projection, which is described below. The very awareness of transference mitigates its effects in our practice. With a cloak of invisibility, playwork is easy. Without it, we have to find ways to manage, and this means knowing the theories of play and best practices of supporting play and then applying these theories and practices.

One day in London’s Mile End Park I watched as Joe, a playworker, worked with a group of children at the Festival of Earth. He set up the clay and water table with a perimeter wall of clay and then idly played with it himself, seeming to explore not only its potential but to validate the messiness of it. Then the children came, and he seemed to disappear. This happened time and time again. A child would be stuck, perhaps needing something like a small world toy. Rather than have the child surface from her immersion in the play, Joe would become briefly visible, the item or support that was needed would quietly appear near enough for the child to discover it for herself, and then Joe would fade away again. Yet he never left the space that the children were in.

I watched him doing this and still could not work out quite how he managed to be so effective and so invisible at the same time.


### 6. Trivialization of play

This is a state of mind that perceives and positions play as trivial fripperies that are permissible for a few years in early childhood at a time when children (generally considered to be adults in training) can waste time with idle inane fun. It becomes infantilized. It is a brightly colored phenomenon, primary colors usually, though bubble gum pink is allowed. It is not thought to have any considerable substance and certainly does not fulfill any function—other than creating Kodak moments of fun. Balloons, bouncy castles, zoomorphic face painting, and jolly dungareed party entertainers are obligatory.

This perception of play has nothing to do with the processes of playing that allow the internal world of the child to come out and discover how to experience and assimilate the external world. It does not entertain the thought that the need for play stretches over many thousands of years and is in the business of giving voice to the richest emotional pallet. Instead, it is a world filled with the equivalent of the springy chickens one finds on playgrounds.

### 7. Commodification of play

We spend a fortune on toys for children, on experiences and entertainments.
Big business has targeted childhood as a captive market. Sell parents the concept that an idyllic childhood can be bought and sit back and count the zeros. Childhood is spent with screens and plastic geegaws. Birthday parties cost a bomb. Days out are bought times.

Because of this materialistic approach to play and childhood, many children have gotten the message that valid experiences are bought experiences, a financial deal. If we take them to the beach, sit back, and let them play for as long as they like, they don’t necessarily know what to do. Because there is no price attached to the experience, it does not feel valid to them. Have you had your play validated today?

If we focus on the validation of play through intelligent observation and reflection we can create a different currency. Let’s go back to the cardboard box as a loose part, a simple, open-ended play material that can be used in dozens of ways. This is a truly marvellous play opportunity.

I visited a family in San Francisco. They had recently discovered that their very small children did not need to join clubs and after-school activities or watch videos to have a rich and fulfilled childhood. I went into the house and the eldest child called out for permission to get the boxes from the den to make a building. He and his little sister built and imagined and negotiated while they explored my playfulness as a safe stranger in their home, under the aegis of their mother, and showed me illustrations from their books of the animals that they were being in their games.

Their mom had spoken about the peer pressure she felt to send her children to art-soccer-drama-gym classes. These were very young children who had narrowly escaped being sorted by age into adult-organized activities. And here they were, playing richly together, developing physical, emotional, linguistic, and social skills and so much more than they would have had the chance to do if they had been ferried around from class to class as part of a purchased childhood. Gordon
Sturrock12 mischievously suggests a “penny on the pound” tax on all childhood marketing and products, the revenue to be turned over to the play sector.

We need to validate playing in a real and personal and local way, not sit back and allow the process of childhood to be stolen from our children. Childhood should not be for sale.
